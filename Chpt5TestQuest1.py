    Using the code above, reprogram this app to use 2 functions, one called main(),
    one called square(). Also use a conditional statement to launch the application

# Create the main() function: this will collect the user input and then calls the
# square() function.


# Create the square() function: This will take the argument from the function call
# and use it to calculate the square. Make sure you return the value of the square
# back to the main function.


# Create the conditional statement as the entry point for the application. HINT an if
# statement that calls the main() function.
